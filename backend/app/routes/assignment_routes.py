Assignment Routes Module

Purpose: API routes for training assignment management
Features:
- Assign trainings to employees (managers only)
- Get assignments for current user
- Get team assignments (managers only)
- Delete assignments

Endpoints:
- POST /assignments/: Assign training to employee
- GET /assignments/my: Get current user's assignments
- GET /assignments/manager/team: Get team assignments (manager only)
- DELETE /assignments/{id}: Delete assignment
